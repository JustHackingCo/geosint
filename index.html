		<h2> Directions </h2>
		<p>Hello and welcome to Geosint. This main page is where you can find challenges from 
		various competitions. If you are here for a specific competition, make sure you choose
		challenges from the appropriate category on the left. Newer competitions will show up
		at the top of the list. I have left up challenges from previous competitions in case 
		anyone wants to give them a crack :)</p><br/>
		<p>If you are familiar with <a href="https://www.geoguessr.com/" target="_blank">GeoGuessr</a>,
		then you probably already know how to play! If not, feel free to click on a challenge
		to give it a try.</p><br/>
		<p>To submit a guess, click somewhere on the mini-map and hit "Submit". You should 
		receive a yes or no answer depending on if you were correct. "no" means you are 
		incorrect and "yes + flag" means you got it right!</p><br/>
		<p>Time to put your Geo OSINT skills to the test!</p>
